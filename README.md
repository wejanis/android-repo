# Fitness Tracking Application

I made a fitness tracking application for android with features such as:

User registration: Register for an account and their information is stored on a server.
User login/logout: Login using registered information. The user can also choose to be remembered so they don't have to retype credentials.
Tracking exercises:
  -Add one or multiple workout exercises to a day on the calendar and track the weight and reps as well as completion of the exercise.
  -Update, Copy, or Delete exercises.
  -Swipe between days on the calendar or use a date picker to select a specific date and view exercises tracked on that date.
